This repository contains the Supporting Information for the paper "Characterisation of genetically encoded hydrogen peroxide sensor dynamics" by Lind, Rohwer, Veal and Pillay. The following
files are in the repository:
1. An Excel file that can be used to determine the signal parameters (AUC, Signal Time, Duration and Amplitude) of a genetically encodes redox sensor dataset. 
2. A file containing the text needed for a Google Colab notebook. Note that a notebook is presented here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PzkLiZoITGU8Qo89Foz1TjSLOKaUvMdW?usp=sharing 
3. All the datasets and Python code used for main paper.
